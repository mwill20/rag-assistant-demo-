# Ready Tensor AAIDC â Project 1 (Mock Notes)

This project builds a minimal RAG assistant using LangChain and Chroma.
Key components: document loaders, text splitter (chunk ~1000, overlap ~200),
SentenceTransformers embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and a retriever that returns
citations to source chunks.

Submission: publication with GitHub repo, clear README, and optional 60â90s demo video.
